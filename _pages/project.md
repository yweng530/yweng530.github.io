**Image Blending with Gradient-Domain Fusion (Sep. 2023 - Oct. 2023)**

Python, OpenCV, Google Colab

• Implemented Poisson Blending technique to seamlessly blend an object from a source image into a target image.

• Enhanced blending results through the implementation of Mixed Gradients technique, resulting in better visual coherence and reductions in artifacts.

• Leveraged gradient-domain processing to convert a color image to grayscale while preserving important contrast information.


**Flight Tickets Booking System (Jun. 2022 - Aug. 2022)**

ReactJS, NodeJS, Google Cloud Platform

• Spearheaded the design and development of the web application’s frontend using ReactJS, enhancing user
experience and interface aesthetics.

• Implemented full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for the passenger database, optimizing data
management and accessibility, with seamless integration into Google Cloud Platform.

• Enhanced application functionality by introducing stored procedures and triggers, resulting in improved system
responsiveness and user interaction.


**Open Flights (Oct. 2021 - Dec. 2021)**

C++, VSCode

• Utilized the OpenFlight dataset to devise an algorithm for finding the shortest path between two airports,
optimizing travel route planning.

• Implemented BFS Traversal and Dijkstra’s Algorithm to accomplish the project goal, demonstrating
problem-solving skills and algorithmic expertise in project completion.

• Developed a Degree Centrality Algorithm to identify and rank the busiest and most popular airports globally,
providing valuable insights into air travel trends.
